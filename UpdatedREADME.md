CS 330 Final Project – 3D Scene and Design Reflection
Portfolio Submission
This repository contains the two required components for my CS 330 portfolio submission:

3D Scene ZIP Folder: Complete OpenGL-based scene featuring modular objects, lighting, and shadow mapping.

Design Decisions Document: Detailed explanation of architectural choices, rendering pipeline, material system, and lighting configuration.

These files demonstrate my ability to build a fully realized 3D environment using structured design and development strategies.

Reflection
How do I approach designing software? I begin by identifying core components and their relationships, then build modular systems that support scalability and reuse. For this project, I used centralized functions and constants to manage rendering, transformations, and materials.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I developed a stronger understanding of shader-based rendering, modular scene composition, and how to structure reusable transformation logic across multiple objects.

What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed an iterative design process, starting with basic geometry and layering in lighting, materials, and camera controls. Each milestone focused on a specific rubric requirement.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? Modular architecture and centralized configuration are scalable strategies that apply well to simulation, visualization, and game development projects.

How do I approach developing programs? I prioritize clarity, reproducibility, and runtime validation. I build incrementally, test frequently, and use structured feedback to refine behavior.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I implemented a dual shader system for PBR rendering and shadow mapping, and used a depth pass to generate realistic shadows. I also centralized transformation logic for consistency.

How did iteration factor into your development? Iteration was key to refining lighting, material properties, and object placement. Each change was tested visually and adjusted for realism and clarity.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion? My code evolved from procedural blocks to reusable functions with centralized constants. This shift improved maintainability and visual coherence.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? Computer science gives me the tools to build systems that are both functional and expressive. These skills support my goals in technical and creative domains.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? This project deepened my understanding of rendering pipelines, shader logic, and spatial transformations—skills directly applicable to future coursework in simulation and visualization.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? These skills open doors to fields like architectural visualization, interactive media, and real-time simulation. Understanding how to build and optimize 3D environments is valuable across many industries.
